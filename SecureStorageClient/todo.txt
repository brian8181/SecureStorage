*Todo
	
	* remove constant strings!
	* add setting where needed!
	* Settings Form is a mess!	
		
*Done
		* clean tmp.xml & tmp file creation in general
		* new name, SecureStorage, SecureStore, SecureTransStore?, any more ... ?
		* exception initialize remote while not a root in GUI
		
		* deleting directories not working correctly, FIX attempt to delete a non empty directory throw exception (no cascade)
			* deleting dose not cascade, deleting directory only deletes the dir file & not all the files & sub dirs
		* Test Read function
		* Delete form specified path
		* create directory a spefified path
		* create file at specified path 
		* figure out how to load xml from string, I am saving to tm.xml as work around

Not Done:

		* add salt to secure name function, 32 bytes store in xml dir file
		* NO! (this would break random access to file by path!) look into a diffent naming schema
					* a guid for each file instead of HMAC, to ease move operations
